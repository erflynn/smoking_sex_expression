## Project setup:

Within the google drive, there is a `data` directory, which has all the data we need for the analysis. We will update these files as we go.

We also have a github that has all the code we will be using.

For shared .csv files, write them to the google directory.
For .RData objects and intermediate files, save these locally. We can setup something later with a server, but for now this is simplest.
